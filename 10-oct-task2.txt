What is RabbitMQ?

RabbitMQ is a message broker a tool that helps different parts of a system talk to each other by sending messages asynchronously (without waiting for a reply).  
It works by:

- Receiving messages from one part of the system
- Storing them safely
- Delivering them to the right destination

RabbitMQ is built using Erlang, a programming language known for handling tasks like concurrency (multiple tasks at once), fault tolerance (handling errors smoothly), and clustering (grouping servers together).  
It supports various messaging protocols, most commonly **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol).

Why Use Queues in Real-Time Systems?

Queues in RabbitMQ help manage communication between Producers (who send messages) and Consumers (who receive them). They offer several benefits:

1. Decoupling – Senders and receivers don’t need to be active at the same time.
2. Load Balancing – Messages are spread evenly across multiple consumers.
3. Reliability – Messages are stored safely, even if a service crashes.
4. Asynchronous Processing – Producers can keep working without waiting for consumers to finish.
5. Scalability – Easy to add more consumers as needed.
6. Flow Control – Queues act as buffers to prevent system overload.
