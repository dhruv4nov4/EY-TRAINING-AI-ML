Azure Queue Storage vs Azure Service Bus

Azure Queue Storage
- A basic queuing solution integrated with Azure Storage.
- Communicates over HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
- Message ordering is not guaranteedâ€”attempts FIFO but not strictly enforced.
- Lacks native support for duplicate message detection and transactional operations.
- Maximum message size is 64 KB.
- Ensures delivery at least once, but duplicates may occur.
- No automatic dead-letter queue; must be managed manually.
- Offers a straightforward FIFO structure with minimal features.
- Cost-effective and well-suited for simple, loosely coupled systems.
- Ideal for background tasks, basic message exchange, and lightweight architectures.

Azure Service Bus
- A robust messaging platform built for sophisticated communication needs.
- Uses the AMQP protocol, with optional HTTP support.
- Enables strict FIFO through session-based message sequencing.
- Supports built-in duplicate detection and transactional messaging.
- Message size limits: 256 KB (Standard) and up to 1 MB (Premium).
- Provides both at-least-once and exactly-once delivery options.
- Includes automatic dead-letter queues for handling failed messages.
- Offers advanced capabilities like topics, subscriptions, scheduled delivery, and message forwarding.
- Higher cost but packed with features for enterprise-grade reliability.
- Best suited for distributed applications, financial systems, and publish/subscribe models.

When to Choose Azure Queue Storage
- You need a straightforward, budget-friendly queuing service.
- Message order and duplication aren't major concerns.
- Perfect for background job processing and lightweight service interactions.

When to Choose Azure Service Bus
- You require advanced messaging tools like pub/sub, transactions, or message filtering.
- Message sequencing and duplicate prevention are essential.
- Your system depends on dead-lettering and complex routing.
- Designed for mission-critical workflows, microservices, and enterprise-grade solutions.
